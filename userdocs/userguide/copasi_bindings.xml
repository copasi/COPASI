<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
This document tries to give a superficial overview of the COPASI backend API. This documentation is in no way meant to give a complete reference to the API. It is only intended to give the programmer that wants to use the library or the language bindings an overview of the classes and some examples on how certain things can be done.
The language bindings expose parts of the underlying C++ API and so far no attempt has been made to simplify the API to better fit the target language or to make it easier for the programmer. All there is so far is a way to use COPASIs classes and methods from several languages.
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 condition="CPP" id="initialization">
<title>Initialization of the library</title>
<para>
Before the COPASI backend library can be used in C++, it has to be initialized.
Initialization should be done as follows:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
// initialize some system variables
// argc and argv are the parameters that the main rountine gets
// alternatively, 0 and NULL may be passed as argc and argv.
COptions::init(argc, argv);
// Create the root container.
CCopasiContainer::init();
// Create the global data model.
CCopasiDataModel::Global = new CCopasiDataModel;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
It is best to do the initialization in a try...catch block.
</para>
<para>
Once the backend is no longer needed, it can be deinitialized by deleting the global datamodel and the root container.
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
delete CCopasiDataModel::Global;
delete CCopasiContainer::Root;
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
In order to be more portable, the C++ backend of COPASI makes extensive use of typedefs for several datatypes. All those typedefs can be found in the copasi.h header file which has to be included by all programs that want to use the COPASI backend library in a C++ program.
</para>
<para>
And last, but not least, the statement "#define COPASI_MAIN" should occur at the very beginning (before copasi.h is included) of your source file that contains the main routine, otherwise, you will not be able to link against the COPASI library.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="model">
<title>Working with the model</title>

<sect2 id="modeConcept">
<title>COPASIs Model Concept</title>

<para>
In COPASI, the top level class in the backend is <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis>. This class contains the actual model as well as the tasks, the function database and all the output definitions (plots and reports). Right now, this class defines one global static instance of itself and many methods in COPASIs backend rely on and work with this instance. Creating a second instance  of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> therefore does not make much sense and will most likely lead to crashes sooner or later. If you work with the COPASI bindings, you are restricted to this one global instance which means that working with more than one model at any given time on one machine is not possible right now.
</para>
<para condition="JAVA">
<emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> provides the static method <emphasis>getGlobal()</emphasis> to get the global static instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis>.

In addition to these methods <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> provides some methods for loading COPASI files or importing SBML files, for saving COPASI files or exporting SBML files, for creating new models and for adding tasks to the task list.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="modelElements" xreflabel="modelElements">
<title>Model Elements</title>

<para>
The class in COPASI that contains the actual model data is <emphasis>CModel</emphasis>. The current model can be obtained from the global static instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> via the <emphasis>getModel()</emphasis> method. To create a new empty model, <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> provides the method <emphasis>newModel()</emphasis>. There is also the method <emphasis condition="JAVA">loadModel(String filename)</emphasis><emphasis condition="CPP">loadModel(std::string filename)</emphasis><emphasis condition="PYTHON">loadModel(FILENAME_STRING)</emphasis> which loads a COPASI model from the given filename, the method <emphasis condition="JAVA">importSBML(String filename)</emphasis><emphasis condition="CPP">importSBML(std::string filename)</emphasis><emphasis condition="PYTHON">importSBML(FILENAME_STRING)</emphasis> which imports an SBML model from the file with the given name and last but not least the method <emphasis condition="JAVA">importSBMLFromString(String sbmlModelText)</emphasis><emphasis condition="CPP">importSBMLFromString(std::string sbmlModelText)</emphasis><emphasis condition="PYTHON">importSBMLFromString(SBML_CONTENT_STRING)</emphasis> which imports an SBML model from the given string. The string must be a valid SBML model string. All three methods return a boolean value which is <emphasis condition="CPP">true</emphasis><emphasis condition="JAVA">true</emphasis><emphasis condition="PYTHON">True</emphasis> if the method succeeded and <emphasis condition="CPP">false</emphasis><emphasis condition="JAVA">false</emphasis><emphasis condition="PYTHON">False</emphasis> otherwise.
</para>

<para>
Once the model has been obtained, it can be manipulated in many ways. New model elements like compartments, metabolites, reactions and/or global parameters can be created, modified or removed. The model also has some methods to manipulate the time-, volume- and substance units of the model. Unlike SBML, models in COPASI only have global units and the units of all elements of the model are made up of these global units. Units on individual elements are not supported.
</para>

<para>
To find out how many compartments, metabolites, reactions or global parameters (model values) a model has, <emphasis>CModel</emphasis> has the following methods.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting condition="JAVA">
// return the number of compartments in the model

<para>
Naturally model elements can also be removed via their keys. Each object in COPASI which is derived from <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis> gets a unique id when it is created which in COPASI is called key. To get the key for such an object, <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis> provides the method <emphasis>getKey()</emphasis>.
<emphasis>CModel</emphasis>, <emphasis>CCompartment</emphasis>, <emphasis>CMetab</emphasis>, <emphasis>CModelValue</emphasis> and <emphasis>CReaction</emphasis> are all derived from <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis> and you can therefore get the key for any of them via the <emphasis>getKey()</emphasis> method which returns the key in the form of a string.
</para>

<para>
The methods to delete elements from the model are:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting condition="JAVA">
boolean removeCompartment(String key);
boolean removeMetabolite(String key);
boolean removeModelValue(String key);
boolean removeReaction(String key);

bool removeReaction(const std::string&amp; key);
</programlisting>
<programlisting condition="PYTHON">
# each function get the key of the object that is to be removed

# operation succeeded
SUCCESS=removeCompartment(KEY_STRING)
SUCCESS=removeMetabolite(KEY_STRING)
SUCCESS=removeModelValue(KEY_STRING)
SUCCESS=removeReaction(KEY_STRING)
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
These methods also delete all dependent objects. So if a compartment is deleted, all metabolites in that compartment are also deleted and if those metabolites were part of reaction those reactions are deleted as well.
</para>

<para>
For example, to delete the third metabolite in the model you could write the following code (provided that there are at least three metabolites in the model):

If you want to work with concentrations rather than particle numbers, <emphasis>CMetab</emphasis> provides the methods <emphasis>getConcentration()</emphasis>, <emphasis>getInitialConcentration()</emphasis> and <emphasis>setInitialConcentration(double c)</emphasis> to get the concentration, initial concentration or set the initial concentration respectively. The class also provides the method <emphasis>getCompartment()</emphasis> which returns the compartment of the metabolite.

<para>
The <emphasis>getFunction</emphasis> method returns the function that is used as the kinetic law. In COPASI all kinetic laws are determined by function calls. Using an expression as a kinetic law is not supported. All kinetic law expressions that are imported from SBML files are first converted to function definitions with a call to that function as the kinetic law. When those models are reexported, all expressions are exported as function calls.
There are exceptions to this rule however. If COPASI determines that a given rate law is a Mass Action rate law, no function definition is created but the Mass Action function build into COPASI is used as the kinetic law. On reexport to SBML, the kinetic law is converted to a Mass Action expression again. In the future, similar procedures might be used for other function types as for example constant flux.

<title>Setting initial values on model entities</title>

<para>
It is not obvious what consequences it has when the initial values of model entities are changed because changing the initial value of a model entity might influence other initial values, e.g. compartment volumes influence the concentration of the contained metabolites.
Therefore, it is not enough to just set the initial values on model entities, but it is necessary to tell COPASI which objects have been changed so that COPASI can update dependent values.
This update is executed with the <emphasis>updateInitialValues</emphasis> method of <emphasis>CModel</emphasis>. The method takes one argument which is a container that stores all initial values that have been changed in the model. The container is an instance of <emphasis>ObjectStdVector</emphasis> and store objects of type <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis>. The objects stored there are the actual values that have been changed, not the model entities the values belong to, e.g. if the initial concentration of a metabolite has been changed, an object representing this initial concentration can be acquire by calling <emphasis>getObject</emphasis> on the model entity with a <emphasis>CCopasiObjectName</emphasis> as the argument that specifies what value to get.
So assuming <emphasis>container</emphasis> is an instance of <emphasis>ObjectStdVector</emphasis> and <emphasis>metab</emphasis> is an instance of <emphasis>CMetab</emphasis> and the initial concentration of <emphasis>metab</emphasis> has been changed, we can add the object that corresponds to the initial concentration of <emphasis>metab</emphasis> with
</para>

<para>
<programlisting condition="JAVA">
container.add(metab.getObject(new CCopasiObjectName("Reference=InitialConcentration")));
</programlisting>
<programlisting condition="CPP">
pContainer->add(pMetab->getObject(CCopasiObjectName("Reference=InitialConcentration")));
</programlisting>
<programlisting condition="PYTHON">
container.push_back(metab.getObject(CCopasiObjectName("Reference=InitialConcentration")))
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The same procedure can be used for the initial volume of compartments, he initial value of parameters and the value of local reaction parameters. The respective strings to initialize the CCopasiObjectName instance are <screen>"Reference=InitialVolume"</screen>, <screen>"Reference=InitialValue"</screen> and <screen>"Reference=Value"</screen>.
Once all changed values have been added to the container, <emphasis>updateInitialValues</emphasis> can by called on the instance of <emphasis>CModel</emphasis> with the container as the only argument.

<title>The Task-Problem-Method Concept in COPASI</title>

<para>
In COPASI calculations you can do on the current model are represented by so called tasks. The base class for all tasks is <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis>. Each task contains a problem represented by a subclass of <emphasis>CCopasiProblem</emphasis> and a method represented by a subclass of <emphasis>CCopasiMethod</emphasis>.
For a given task type, e.g. time course simulation, there is one task class, one problem class and one or more method classes. The problem of a task describes what is going to be done when the task is run and the method describes how it is done.
Lets make this a little more clear by looking at the task class for running time course simulations on a model. The task class for this is <emphasis>CTrajectoryTask</emphasis> and is contains an instance of the problem class <emphasis>CTrajectoryProblem</emphasis>. The problem for the time course simulation stores the parameters for the simulation like start time, end time and number of steps. The method class for the time course task is a subclass of <emphasis>CTrajectoryMethod</emphasis> which itself is a subclass of <emphasis>CCopasiMethod</emphasis>. At the time of writing, there were six method classes derived from <emphasis>CTrajectoryMethod</emphasis>. Two of the method classes are for deterministic simulation, two are for stochastic simulation and two are for hybrid simulation. Each of the methods contains parameters that are specific to the method and which can be changed to influence the corresponding method.
</para>

<para>
All tasks are stored in <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis>. <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> provides the method <emphasis>getTaskList()</emphasis> to get the list of tasks. The returned object is of the type <emphasis>TaskVectorN</emphasis> and provides a method called <emphasis>size()</emphasis> to find out how many tasks it contains and a method <emphasis CONDITION="JAVA">get(long index)</emphasis><emphasis CONDITION="CPP">get(C_INT32 index)</emphasis><emphasis CONDITION="PYTHON">get(INDEX)</emphasis> to retrieve the task with the given index. The object that is returned is of type <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis>. Alternatively, <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis> has a method called <emphasis CONDITION="JAVA">getTask(long index)</emphasis><emphasis CONDITION="CPP">getTask(C_INT32 index)</emphasis><emphasis CONDITION="PYTHON">getTask(INDEX)</emphasis> which returns the <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis> object with the given index.
</para>

<para>
To get the problem and the method for a given task, <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis> provides the methods <emphasis>getProblem()</emphasis> and <emphasis>getMethod()</emphasis> respectively and the objects returned are of type <emphasis>CCopasiProblem</emphasis> and <emphasis>CCopasiMethod</emphasis>. Normally there is no need to cast the task, problem or method objects to the most specific subclass since the base classes already provide all the needed functionality.
</para>

<para>
All that is needed to run any task is 
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem><para>get the correct task from the instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>if the task does not exist yet, create a new one and add it to the instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>change the parameters of the problem if the default values are not O.K.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>change the parameters on the method if the default values are not O.K.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
The procedure is (almost) the same no matter what the task might be, although some tasks might need some additional steps. What those additional steps are will be explained in the corresponding sections below.   
</para>

<para>
The first thing is to get the correct task. For this the type of the task has to be known. The type of a task is an integer value and a list of all known types can be found in CCopasiTask.java. Some of those tasks are not available from Java yet. If we look at this list, we see that the type for the time course simulation task is CCopasiTask.timeCourse. So in order to find the time course task, we write a loop that checks all tasks that the CCopasiDataModel instance knows if one has the correct type. For each task type, there can be at most one task.
</para>

<para>
So to find the time course simulation task we could use the following code:
</para>

<para>

The classes <emphasis>CCopasiProblem</emphasis> and <emphasis>CCopasiMethod</emphasis> are both derived from <emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis>, they inherit all the methods from <emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis> to set their parameters.
There are two ways to get a parameter, the first method retrieves a parameter by its index, the second method gets the parameter via its name.

</para>

<para>
<emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis>s methods <emphasis>size()</emphasis> can be used to find out how many parameters are part of the parameter group.
Each instance of <emphasis>CCopasiParameter</emphasis> has a type that determines what kind of values are allowed for the parameter. E.g. it determines if the parameter represents an integer a float value or a string.
Depending on the type of the parameter which can be acquire with the <emphasis>type()</emphasis> method, the parameters value has to be set with a specific method.
Let us for example look at the parameter called "Duration" which is a parameter of CTrajectoryProblem and determines up to which time the simulation will be calculated. The parameter itself stores a double value. Assuming you already have the correct task, you can set this parameter as follows.    
</para>

<para>
<programlisting condition="JAVA">

This would set the parameter so that running a simulation would simulate a time length of $100.3$ time units.

<para>
Most of the time you will only have to deal with the numeric parameters of type DOUBLE, INT, UINT or BOOL.
</para>

<para>
Next the method has to be set on the task. The method of a task can be set with the <emphasis>setMethodType(int type)</emphasis> method of <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis> the argument to the method is an integer that specifies the type of the method. All methods known to COPASI have a specific type and all those types are defined in CCopasiMethod.java. Not all methods are applicable to all tasks, normally a task has a certain set of methods that can be used with the task. If the method type passed to <emphasis>setMethodType</emphasis> is not applicable to the task on which the method has been called, the method return a value of <emphasis>false</emphasis>, otherwise it returns <emphasis>true</emphasis>.
To find out which method is currently set on a task, you can use a call to <emphasis>getMethodType()</emphasis> which will return an integer representing the method.
</para>

<para>
Which method can be used with which task will be described in the documentation for the individual tasks.
One the correct method has been set, the method parameters can be changed which works exactly the same way as described for the parameter of the problem above, the only difference is that the methods are used in an instance of <emphasis>CCopasiMethod</emphasis> which can be obtained from the task with a call to <emphasis>getMethod()</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Once everything has been set, the task can be executed by calling the <emphasis>process(boolean useInitialValues)</emphasis> method. The boolean argument to the method determines if the task will use the current values of all model elements to run or if all values will be reset the the elements initial values. Using the current values rather than the initial values might be useful if a simulation has already been run, but one wants to extend this simulation to get more data points.
When a task is run, the results are either stored in a report if one was defined, and/or in memory. How reports can be defined and how the results for a specific task can be obtained will be explained in the documentation for the specific tasks below.

<para>
Performing a steady state calculation is very similar to running a time course simulation. There is a task instance (<emphasis>CSteadyStateTask</emphasis>) that contains a problem instance (<emphasis>CSteadyStateProblem</emphasis>) and a method instance (<emphasis>CNewtonMethod</emphasis>).
At the time this was written, there is only one method for the steady state calculation, so we have to deal with a fixed set of parameters that can be set on the problem and the method.
The steady state problem has two parameters. One (<emphasis>JacobianRequested</emphasis>) determines if the Jacobian matrix is to be calculated and the other (<emphasis>StabilityAnalysisRequested</emphasis>) determines if a stability analysis is to be done. Both values are boolean values and per default they are set to <emphasis>true</emphasis>.

The first argument is a <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> value that determines whether the task is started with the current model values or with the initial values of all model entities. The second argument is an int value that can be either <emphasis>CCopasiTask.NO_OUTPUT</emphasis> or <emphasis>CCopasiTask.OUTPUT_COMPLETE</emphasis> which determined if output is generated from the task or not. This is important if reports have been defined for the task (see section <link linkend="reports">Creating Reports</link>).

After the task has finished, the results can be queried via several methods provided by the <emphasis>CSteadyStateTask</emphasis> instance.

The result of the steady state calculation is read directly from the state of the model itself, because after the calculation of the steadystate, the model will contain that state in the transient values of all model entities. So if one wants to find the concentration of some metabolite at the steady state, it can be acquire directly by getting the transient concentration from this metabolite.
This works as long as the model has not been changed by adding or removing model entities or by doing any calculations on the model.

<para>
In order to run a parameter scan, one or more so called scan items have to be defined. Currently COPASI knows three types of scan items: repeat, linear and random. A parameter scan can define several scan items that are stacked and each scan item is applied to the scan item directly beneath it. The simplest scan item is the repeat type. It repeats the scan item (or if it is the lowest scan item it repeats the subtask) below it a certain number of times. No parameter is changed by this scan item type. This can e.g. be used to run a stochastic simulation several times with different random number seeds. (The stochastic time course simulation has a parameter that determines if it is started with a random seed, if this is set to false, the exactly same stochastic simulation will be run several times.)
The linear scan item changes an associated model value (usually this will be the initial value of some model entity) within a given range. The stepsize is determined by the number of steps that is given as a parameter. The name of this scan item might be somewhat misleading since it can also change the associated value in a logarithmic fashion rather than in a linear fashion.
Last but not least the random scan item can be used to initialize the associated value with a random value. The random value is determined by a permitted range and a distribution function.
The scan items are implemented as a nested parameter group. All parameters for the scan items are actually parameters that are stored in a parameter group which represents a scan item.
The class <emphasis>CScanProblem</emphasis> which itself is also derived from <emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis> contains a parameter group called <emphasis>ScanItems</emphasis> which holds all the scan items.
So in the end the instance of <emphasis>CScanProblem</emphasis> holds a parameter group called <emphasis>ScanItems</emphasis> which holds parameter groups that represent the individual scan items and those groups hold the parameters that determine the properties of the scan items.

<para>
It is important to note that the subtask that is going to be used by the parameter scan has to be set up properly prior to running the parameter scan. That is, if one wants to run a parameter scan on a stochastic simulation, the time course task has to be set up so that it runs a stochastic simulation. Also all other parameters like start time and end time etc. have to be specified for the trajectory task before running the parameter scan.
The same applies to all other subtasks that are or will be enabled in the future.
</para>

<para>
For the task describes so far, one was usually interested in the end result of the task. For parameter scans this is usually different. Here one is normally interested in the result of each calculation of the subtask that the parameter scan is being run on.
Unfortunately those results are not stored in memory, so right now the only way to get these results is to create a report that stores them to a file. For a documentation on how to create reports and how they are connected to a task see the section on reports <link linkend="reports">Creating Reports</link>.

<sect2 id="optimizations" xreflabel="optimizations">
<title>Running Optimizations</title>

<para>
In order to run an optimization, the general procedure is the same as with the other tasks. One has to acquire or create an instance of <emphasis>COptTask</emphasis>, choose the desired method to use for the task out of the set of methods COPASI provides for the optimization, set the desired parameter values on the instance of <emphasis>COptProblem</emphasis> that can be fetched from the <emphasis>COptTask</emphasis> instance and maybe set some parameter values on the method to change the methods behaviour.
At the time of writing, an optimization can either be done with a time course calculation or a steady state calculation. In order to tell the problem which of the two to use, the problem has a method called setSubtaskType. Valid arguments for the method are CCopasiTask.steadyState or CCopasiTask.timeCourse;
The parameters that can be set on the methods very much depend on the method that is being used. So if you want to find out which parameters each method provides you will have to read the COPASI manual which if you are lucky does list them.
Before running the optimization, two more items have to be set. One is the object that should be optimized, e.g. the initial value of some parameter, the other item is the objective function that the optimization uses the determine the optimal result.
The object(s) that are going to be optimized are determined by one or more instances of <emphasis>COptItem</emphasis>. Each <emphasis>COptItem</emphasis> object stores a reference to the model object to optimize, the start value with which the optimization process will begin and an upper and a lower bound for the value of the object. The optimization method will then try to find values for all objects so that the objective function will (in the optimal case) become minimal.
The objective function itself also needs to be specified before the optimization can be run. The objective function is an expression that COPASI tries to minimize by changing the values of the objects referenced in the specified <emphasis>COptItem</emphasis>s. In order to set the objective function, the <emphasis>COptProblem</emphasis> instance has a method called <emphasis>setObjectiveFunction</emphasis>. This method takes a string that represents the mathematical expression of the function. The mathematical expression can contain all elements that can be used to describe expressions as described in the COPASI manual. Model objects that are used in the expression have to be referenced with their so called common name enclosed in angular brackets (&lt;CN&gt;). To get the common name from an object derived from <emphasis>CCopasiObject</emphasis> the method <emphasis>getCN</emphasis> can be used.

After the optimization has been run, the solution of the optimization is stored in the problem instance.
In order to get the lowest value COPASI was able to find for the objective function, use the call to <emphasis>getSolutionValue</emphasis>.
The values for the <emphasis>COptItem</emphasis> objects corresponding to that result, use <emphasis>getSolutionVariables</emphasis>. This method returns a container with double values.

<sect2 id="parameterFitting" xreflabel="parameterFitting">
<title>Fitting parameters</title>

<para>
Parameter fitting can be used to determine the value of certain model entities with the help of experimental data.
The API for doing parameter fitting is very similar to the one for running an optimization (see above). This is because the classes for parameter fitting are derived from the optimization classes.
This makes sense since the actions for running an optimization are very similar to what COPASI does when doing parameter fitting. The major difference is that for an optimization, the user has to provide an objective function that is minimized whereas for the parameter fitting, the user provides experimental data and some information about the data and COPASI determines the objective function from that information.
</para>

<para>
The first step when doing parameter fitting is to get an instance of <emphasis>CFitTask</emphasis>. Either there is already one in the list of tasks which can be used, or we simplify add one, as demonstrated in the example below.
The <emphasis>CFitTask</emphasis> has the methods <emphasis>getMethod</emphasis> and <emphasis>getProblem</emphasis> which provide the method and the problem for the task.
</para>

<para>
The methods that can be used for parameter fitting should be the same set of methods that is available for the optimization. The methods that are available can be queried with <emphasis>getValidMethods</emphasis> in <emphasis>CFitTask</emphasis> and a specific method can be set with <emphasis>setMethodType</emphasis> also in <emphasis>CFitTask</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Most settings for the parameter fitting however are done in the problem. The problem contains a parameter group called <emphasis>Experiment Set</emphasis> which contains the information about the experimental data against which the parameters should be fitted.
The information for each experiment is stored in an instance of <emphasis>CExperiment</emphasis>. The information that needs to be provided for each experment is 
</para>

<para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>the name of the file where the experimental data can be found</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the row number where the data for the experiment starts</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the row number where the data for the experiment ends</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the type of experiment that the data represents (time course or steady state)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the number of data columns in the data set</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>the mapping of the columns to the entities in the model and their role</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>
Another useful piece of information that can be set for the experiment is the separator that is used in the data file to separate the individual columns. This separator can be set with the <emphasis>setSeparator</emphasis> method in <emphasis>CExperiment</emphasis>. It takes a string as its only argument. One thing to watch out for is the fact that COPASI tries to match the separator exactly. That is, if the separator is set to be one space character, having two space characters between two columns in the file will lead COPASI to think that there is an empty column. Unfortunately there is no way right now to tell COPASI that the delimiter for the columns is e.g. one or more space characters.
</para>

<para>
The information about the mapping from data columns to model entities is stored in an instance of <emphasis>CExperimentObjectmap</emphasis> which can be aquired with the <emphasis>getObjectMap</emphasis> method from <emphasis>CExperiment</emphasis>.
After the information for the experiment has been set, the experiment needs to be added to the experiment set. The <emphasis>addExperiment</emphasis> method creates a copy of the experiment that is added, so make sure that you get the experiment from the experiment set before you make further modifications or use it, e.g. to add it to the fit item (see below).
</para>

<para>
Next we need to create the fit items which correspond to the optimization items in the optimization task. Fit items are instances of <emphasis>CFitItem</emphasis> and they have an upper bound, a lower bound and a start value just like optimization items.
By default each fit item is influenced by all experiments. if you want to limit a fit item to be only influenced by certain experiments, you have to add those experiments to the fit item with the <emphasis>addExperiment</emphasis> method of <emphasis>CFitItem</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
There is no specialized method to add fit items to the fit problem, so we have to use the generic methods provided be <emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis> to do this. The fit problem contains a parameter group called <emphasis>OptimizationItemList</emphasis> which holds all the fit items. Since the problem itself is derived from <emphasis>CCopasiParameterGroup</emphasis>, we can use the <emphasis>getParameter</emphasis> method with the name of the parameter in order to get the parameter group. Now we can add the fit items with the <emphasis>addParameter</emphasis> method to the group.
Just like the <emphasis>addExperiment</emphasis> method above, this method makes a copy of its argument, so if you are planning to use the fit item again, be sure to get the fit item from the group again.
</para>

<para>
A fit problem can actually contain many experiments and many fit items, but the example code below only uses one experiment and one fit item to fit the reaction parameter of a simple system. The code assumes that the models consists of only one compartment with two species named <emphasis>A</emphasis> and <emphasis>B</emphasis> as well as one reaction with a local reaction parameter (which is fitted).

<para>
Sometimes it is necessary to write the results of a calculation to a file instead of keeping it in memory. In order to achieve this, a report for the results has to be created and this report has to be associated with a task.
In COPASI reports are represented by the class <emphasis>CReport</emphasis>. A report stored a so called report definition that specifies what is being written and it contains a filename that determines where the report is written to.
In order to set the filename, you can use the method <emphasis>setTarget</emphasis> with the path of the file as the argument. It is up to the programmer to make sure that the directory part of the path exists and that it is writable.
To set the report definition of a report instance, use the method <emphasis>setReportDefinition</emphasis>. The only argument to the call is an instance of class <emphasis>CReportDefinition</emphasis>.
A report definition can work in two modes. In the default mode, the report definition is a table and all objects that are added to the report definition are written separated by a user definable separator.
In the second mode a report definitions consists of three parts a header, a body and a footer. The part that is specified as the header is written before the associated task is executed, the body is executed for each step of the associated task and the footer is finally written after the task has finished.
Each part is a container that holds zero or more report definition items. To get the individual containers, the <emphasis>CReportDefinition</emphasis> class has the methods <emphasis>getTableAddr</emphasis> if the report definition is in table mode or <emphasis>getHeaderAddr</emphasis>, <emphasis>getBodyAddr</emphasis> and <emphasis>getFooterAddr</emphasis> if it is not in table mode.
To specify whether a report definition is to run in table mode, you can use the method <emphasis>setIsTable</emphasis> which takes a boolean value that determines whether the report definition is a table or not. The flag can be queried with the <emphasis>isTable</emphasis> method.
The individual items are of type <emphasis>CRegisteredObjectName</emphasis>. A new instance of <emphasis>CRegisteredObjectName</emphasis> can be created by calling the constructor with a string that represents the common name of the object that is to written.
If the registered object name should represent a model entity, the string has to be the common name of the object. If you want to add an element the report that represents a simple stirng, you have to create an instance of <emphasis>CCopasiStaticString</emphasis> by calling the constructor of this class with the string that you want to add to the report definition. Once you have an instance of <emphasis>CCopasiStaticString</emphasis>, you can create an instance of <emphasis>CRegisteredObjectName</emphasis> the same way as it is done for other objects, you take the string representation of the common name of your instance of <emphasis>CCopasiStaticString</emphasis> and use it as the argument to the constructor of <emphasis>CRegisteredObjectName</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
In COPASI the reports definitions are stored in the global instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis>. To get this list use the method <emphasis>getReportDefinitionList</emphasis> on the global instance of <emphasis>CCopasiDataModel</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
<programlisting condition="JAVA">
CCopasiDataModel.getGlobal().getReportDefinitionList();
</programlisting>
<programlisting condition="CPP">
CCopasiDataModel::Global->getReportDefinitionList();
</programlisting>
<programlisting condition="PYTHON">
CCopasiDataModel.GLOBAL.getReportDefinitionList()
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>
The returned object is a container that stores all report definitions. To create a new report definition, use <emphasis>createReportDefinitions</emphasis> which is a method of the container. The two arguments to the call are the name of the report definition and a description. Once you have a report definition object, you can use <emphasis>setTaskType</emphasis> to set the type of task the report is intended for. The method takes one argument which is one of the task types defined in <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis>, e.g. <emphasis>CCopasiTask.timeCourse</emphasis> for the time course task.
Next you can fill the tree sections (header, body, footer) of the report definition or the table  with whatever has to be written to the output.
Once the report definition is finished, we have to tell the task to use it. This is done through the tasks report object which can be acquire with the <emphasis>getReport()</emphasis> method of <emphasis>CCopasiTask</emphasis>. The returned report object has a method <emphasis>setReportDefinition</emphasis> which takes the report definition object as its argument.
Last but not least, we have to specify a filename where the report is written to which is done with the <emphasis>setTarget</emphasis> method of the same report object.
The following example shows how to create a report for a time course simulation that writes the values of all global parameters as an xhtml file with a table for the values:
