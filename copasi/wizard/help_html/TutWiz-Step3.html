Your reaction probably don&#8217;t all have a mass-action kinetic, so before
you can run the actual simulation, you have to specify the correct kinetics for
all the reactions. In order to do this, you navigate in the tree on the left to
the reaction that you want to change. Or you can double click on the
reaction in the reaction overview table. In the <em>Reaction Settings</em> dialog you
can change all attributes of the reaction, especially the kinetics and the
associated kinetic parameters.

If necessary, you can do the same for the species and the compartment. Just
use the tree on the left to navigate to the model element you want to change and make the necessary changes
in the dialog on the right.
