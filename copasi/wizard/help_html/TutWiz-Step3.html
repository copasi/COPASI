		Your reactions probably don&#8217;t all have a mass-action kinetic, so before
		you can run the actual simulation, you have to specify the correct kinetics for
		all the reactions. In order to do this, you navigate in the tree on the left to
		the reaction that you want to change. Or you can double click on the
		reaction in the reaction overview table. In the <em>Reaction Settings</em> window you
		can change all attributes of the reaction, especially the kinetics and the
		associated kinetic parameters.

		If necessary, you can do the same for the species and the compartment. Just
		use the tree on the left to navigate to the model element you want to change and make the necessary changes
		in the dialog on the right.
