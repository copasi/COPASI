    <h3>Step 6: Plotting</h3><br>
  </div>
  <p>
    Just like report, plots can be edited or created from scratch if the predefined
    plots from the <em>Output Assistant</em> don&#8217;t fit your needs.
  <p>
    In the object tree on the left in the <em>Output</em> node, you can find the entry
    called <em>Plots</em>. Selecting this will bring you to the plot definition overview
    which will probably be empty. <br>

  <div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    (<a href="#Plot Definition Overview" name="Plot Definition Overview">Click here</a> to go to the plot definition
    overview.)
  </div>
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img alt="figure: Plot definition overview" vspace="20"   src="./figures/NewPlotAdded.png" />
  </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you can either create a new plot by clicking on the <strong><code>New</code></strong> button, or
    you can edit one of the existing plots if there are any. To edit a plot, double
    click on its entry in the table. (For newly created plots, you have to double
    click twice since the first double click will only "commit" the plot.)
    <br>
  <div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img alt="figure: Plot definition dialog" vspace="20"   src="./figures/PlotDefinition.png" />
  </div>
  <br>
  In this dialog you can add more curves, delete curves or change the way
  individual curves are plotted.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to add new curves to the plot, you click on the <strong><code>New curve...</code></strong>
    button. This will open a selection dialog where you can select one item for the
    x-axis of the plot on the left side of the dialog and one or more items for
    the y-axis on the right side of the dialog. E.g. to define a plot of all
    species concentrations against time , you would select the <em>Model Time</em>
    for the x-axis and the transient concentrations of all species for the y-axis.
    <br>
    <br>
  <div style="text-align:center;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <img alt="figure: Curve Selection Dialog" vspace="20"   src="./figures/PlotCurveSelectionDialog.png" />
  </div>

  </p>
  <p>
    Each curve item gets its own entry in the plot definition dialog and you can edit
    attributes of the curve by selecting the corresponding entry in the list at the left. If you click the
    <strong><code>Delete curve</code></strong> button while a entry is selcted, the corresponding curve
    item is deleted from the plot.
  </p>
  <p>Once you are finished with the plot definition,
    you go back to the <em>Time Course</em> dialog and push the <strong><code>Run</code></strong> button again.
    Now you a new plot window like the one below, with the concentrations of all species on the y axis plotted against
    the time on the x axis, should pop up.
