  <h3>Step 6: Plotting</h3><br>
	</center>
	<p>
Just like report, plots can be edited or created from scratch if the predefined
plots from the <em>Output Assistant</em> don&#8217;t fit your needs.
<p>
In the object tree on the left in the <em>Output</em> node, you can find the entry
called <em>Plots</em>. Selecting this will bring you to the plot definition overview
which will probably be empty. <br>
<center>
(<a href="#Plot Definition Overview" name="Plot Definition Overview">Click here</a> to go to the plot definition overview.)
</center>
<br>

</center>
</p>
<p>
Now you can either create a new plot by clicking on the <big><b><code>New</code></b></big> button, or
you can edit one of the existing plots if there are any. To edit a plot, double
click on its entry in the table. (For newly created plots, you have to double
click twice since the first double click will only "commit" the plot.)

</center>
<br>
In this dialog you can add more curves, delete curves or change the way
individual curves are plotted.
</p>
<p>
In order to add new curves to the plot, you click on the <big><b><code>New curve...</code></b></big>
button. This will open a selection dialog where you can select one item for the
x-axis of the plot on the left side of the dialog and one or more items for
the y-axis on the right side of the dialog. E.g. to define a plot of all
species concentrations against time , you would select the <em>Model Time</em>
for the x-axis and the transient concentrations of all species for the y-axis. 
<br>
<br>

</center>

</p>
<p>
Each curve item gets its own tab in the plot definition dialog and you can edit
attributes of the curve by selecting the corresponding tab. If you click the
<big><b><code>Delete curve</code></b></big> button while a tab is selcted, the corresponding curve
item is deleted from the plot.
</p>
<p>Once you are finished with the plot definition,
you go back to the <em>Time Course</em> dialog and push the <big><b><code>Run</code></b></big> button again.
Now you a new plot window like the one below, with the concentrations of all species on the y axis plotted against the time on the x axis, should pop up.
