  /* This is the 12 November 2003 version of */
  /* DLSODA: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with */
  /*         Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems. */

  /* This version is in double precision. */

  /* DLSODA solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff */
  /* systems of first order ODEs, */
  /*     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form, */
  /*     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ). */

  /* This a variant version of the DLSODE package. */
  /* It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods. */
  /* This means that the user does not have to determine whether the */
  /* problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the */
  /* appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method. */

  /* Summary of Usage. */

  /* Communication between the user and the DLSODA package, for normal */
  /* situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset */
  /* of the full set of options available.  See the full description for */
  /* details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix, */
  /* optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and */
  /* instructions for special situations.  See also the example */
  /* problem (with program and output) following this summary. */

  /* A. First provide a subroutine of the form: */
  /*               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT) */
  /*               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*) */
  /* which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i). */

  /* B. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODA once for */
  /* each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide */
  /* for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages */
  /* by DLSODA.  On the first call to DLSODA, supply arguments as follows: */
  /* F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f. */
  /*          This name must be declared External in calling program. */
  /* NEQ    = number of first order ODEs. */
  /* Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ. */
  /* T      = the initial value of the independent variable. */
  /* TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T). */
  /* ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array. */
  /* RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar). */
  /* ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array). */
  /*          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as */
  /*          to be less than */
  /*             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or */
  /*             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2. */
  /*          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component, */
  /*          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)), */
  /*          or the relative error is less than RTOL. */
  /*          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and */
  /*          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error */
  /*          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these */
  /*          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively. */
  /* ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT. */
  /* ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1. */
  /* IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used. */
  /* RWORK  = real work array of length at least: */
  /*             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9). */
  /*          See also Paragraph E below. */
  /* LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension). */
  /* IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ. */
  /* LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension). */
  /* JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix. */
  /*          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph E below. */
  /* JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2. */
  /*          See also Paragraph E below. */
  /* Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK, */
  /* and possibly ATOL. */

  /* C. The output from the first call (or any call) is: */
  /*      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector. */
  /*      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT). */
  /* ISTATE = 2  if DLSODA was successful, negative otherwise. */
  /*          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT). */
  /*          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small). */
  /*          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message). */
  /*          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs). */
  /*          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian */
  /*             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances). */
  /*          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution */
  /*             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.) */
  /*          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages). */

  /* D. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply */
  /* reset TOUT and call DLSODA again.  No other parameters need be reset. */

  /* E. Note: If and when DLSODA regards the problem as stiff, and */
  /* switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ */
  /* Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the */
  /* inputs to DLSODA recommended in Paragraph B above cause DLSODA to */
  /* treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by */
  /* difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band */
  /* matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK */
  /* array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply */
  /* J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC */
  /* argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on */
  /* RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below. */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Example Problem. */

  /* The following is a simple example problem, with the coding */
  /* needed for its solution by DLSODA.  The problem is from chemical */
  /* kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations: */
  /*     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3 */
  /*     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2 */
  /*     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2 */
  /* on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions */
  /* y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff. */

  /* The following coding solves this problem with DLSODA, */
  /* printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses */
  /* ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because */
  /* y2 has much smaller values. */
  /* At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are */
  /* printed (see optional outputs in the full description below). */

  /* Full description of user interface to DLSODA. */

  /* The user interface to DLSODA consists of the following parts. */

  /* 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODA, which is a driver */
  /*      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both */
  /*      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines. */
  /*      following these descriptions is a description of */
  /*      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then */
  /*      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays). */

  /* 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODA package that may be */
  /*      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to */
  /*      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal */
  /*      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t). */

  /* 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay */
  /*      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt */
  /*      of the problem and continued solution later. */

  /* 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODA package, */
  /*      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired. */
  /*      this relates to the measurement of errors. */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 1.  Call Sequence. */

  /* The call sequence parameters used for input only are */
  /*     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, JT, */
  /* and those used for both input and output are */
  /*     Y, T, ISTATE. */
  /* The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and */
  /* optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers */
  /* to the return from Subroutine DLSODA to the user's calling program.) */

  /* The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the */
  /* initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a */
  /* change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input. */

  /* The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows. */

  /* F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the */
  /*          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order */
  /*          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function */
  /*          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to */
  /*          compute the function f.  It is to have the form */
  /*               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT) */
  /*               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*) */
  /*          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y) */
  /*          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ. */
  /*          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). */
  /*          F must be declared External in the calling program. */

  /*          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in */
  /*          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array */
  /*          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1). */
  /*          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below. */

  /*          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed */
  /*          externally to DLSODA, an extra call to F should be made */
  /*          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results. */
  /*          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead. */

  /* NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order */
  /*          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input. */
  /*          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem. */
  /*          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the */
  /*          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if */
  /*          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC. */

  /*          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to */
  /*          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However, */
  /*          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size. */
  /*          (The DLSODA package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case, */
  /*          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls */
  /*          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations */
  /*          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass */

  /*          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be */
  /*          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the */
  /*          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before */
  /*          calling the solver again. */

  /*          optional outputs. */
  /*          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff */
  /*          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the */
  /*          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODA can either */
  /*          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods, */
  /*          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling */
  /*          program in response to output from DLSODA. */

  /*                       --- Fixed Length Case --- */
  /*          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least */
  /*               MAX (LRN, LRS), */
  /*          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the */
  /*          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively. */

  /*          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are */

  /*             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2           if JT = 1 or 2, */
  /*             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ   if JT = 4 or 5. */
  /*          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by: */
  /*             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ, */
  /*             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT, */

  /*                       --- Dynamic Length Case --- */
  /*          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should */
  /*          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the */
  /*          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since */
  /*          DLSODA starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return */
  /*          from DLSODA, the optional output MCUR indicates the current */
  /*          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the */
  /*          previous return, or if there has only been one call to */
  /*          DLSODA and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODA has switched */
  /*          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK */
  /*          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if */
  /*          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required */
  /*          if DLSODA returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.) */
  /*          After resetting the length, call DLSODA with ISTATE = 3 */
  /*          to signal that change. */

  /* LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user. */
  /*          (This will be checked by the solver.) */

  /* IWORK  = an integer array for work space. */
  /*          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff */
  /*          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during */
  /*          problem, between */
  /*             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20, */
  /*          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODA can */
  /*          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a */
  /*          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the */
  /*          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under */
  /*          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need */
  /*          only be at least LIN = 20. */

  /*          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and */
  /*          optional inputs and optional outputs. */

  /*          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs: */
  /*            IWORK(1) = ML     these are the lower and upper */

  /*                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal. */
  /*                       The band is defined by the matrix locations */
  /*                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU */
  /*                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1. */
  /*                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and */
  /*                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be */
  /*                       the band parameters for a matrix to which */
  /*                       df/dy is only approximately equal. */

  /* LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user. */
  /*          (This will be checked by the solver.) */

  /* Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be */
  /* altered between calls to DLSODA for the same problem. */
  /* The contents of the work arrays must not be altered */
  /* between calls, except possibly for the conditional and */
  /* optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK. */
  /* The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is */
  /* available for use by the user outside DLSODA between calls, if */
  /* desired (but not for use by F or JAC). */

  /* JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the */
  /*          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine */
  /*          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much */
  /*          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake */
  /*          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have */
  /*          DLSODA compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.) */
  /*          If and when DLSODA uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ */
  /*          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT = */
  /*          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under */
  /*          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC */
  /*          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t */

  /*          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of */
  /*          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first */
  /*          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in */
  /*          Subroutine F. */
  /*               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are */
  /*          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in */
  /*          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j). */
  /*               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements */
  /*          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise */
  /*          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows */
  /*          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j). */
  /*          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK). */
  /*          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which */
  /*          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored */
  /*          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODA. */
  /*               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude */
  /*          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do. */
  /*               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver, */
  /*          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC. */
  /*          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same */
  /*          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency, */

  /* The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows. */
  /* The form of the call is: */

  /* The input parameters are: */

  /* T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired */
  /*             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODA). */
  /*             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR. */
  /*             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.) */
  /* K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy */
  /*             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order */
  /*             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding */
  /*             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided */
  /*             by DLSODA directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first */
  /*             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY. */
  /* RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH. */
  /* NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ. */

  /* The output parameters are: */

  /* DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value */
  /*             of the K-th derivative of y(t). */
  /* IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal, */
  /*             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal. */
  /*             On an error return, a message is also written. */
  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 3.  Common Blocks. */

  /* If DLSODA is to be used in an overlay situation, the user */
  /* must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in: */
  /*   (1) the call sequence to DLSODA, and */
  /*   (2) the two internal Common blocks */
  /*         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words */
  /*                      followed by 37 integer words), */
  /*         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words */
  /*                      followed by  9 integer words). */

  /* If DLSODA is used on a system in which the contents of internal */
  /* Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should */
  /* declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure */
  /* that their contents are preserved. */

  /* If the solution of a given problem by DLSODA is to be interrupted */
  /* and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run */
  /* or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save, */
  /* following the return from the last DLSODA call prior to the */
  /* interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the */
  /* internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the */
  /* next DLSODA call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common */
  /* blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMA (see Part 2 above). */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines. */

  /* Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODA package which */
  /* relates to the measurement of errors, and can be */
  /* replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such */
  /* a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be */
  /* done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution. */
  /* (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is */
  /* superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.) */

  /* (a) DEWSET. */
  /* The following subroutine is called just before each internal */
  /* integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as */
  /* described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above: */
  /*     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT) */
  /* where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODA call sequence, */
  /* YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and */
  /* EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET. */

  /* If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i) */
  /* (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors */
  /* in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the */
  /* DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODA in the computation */
  /* of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference */
  /* quotient Jacobians. */

  /* In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use */
  /* the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ */
  /* are available from the history array YH, described above under */
  /* optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array, */
  /* extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale */
  /* factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem, */
  /* given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0. */
  /* NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST */
  /* can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements: */
  /*     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS */
  /*     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37) */
  /*     NQ = ILS(33) */
  /*     NST = ILS(34) */
  /*     H = RLS(212) */
  /* Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as */
  /* YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is */
  /* unnecessary when NST = 0). */
