  /* This is the 12 November 2003 version of */
  /* DLSODAR: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with */
  /*          Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems, */
  /*          and with Root-finding. */

  /* This version is in double precision. */

  /* DLSODAR solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff */
  /* systems of first order ODEs, */
  /*     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form, */
  /*     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ). */
  /* At the same time, it locates the roots of any of a set of functions */
  /*     g(i) = g(i,t,y(1),...,y(NEQ))  (i = 1,...,ng). */

  /* This a variant version of the DLSODE package.  It differs from it */
  /* in two ways: */
  /* (a) It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods. */
  /* This means that the user does not have to determine whether the */
  /* problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the */
  /* appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method. */
  /* (b) It finds the root of at least one of a set of constraint */
  /* functions g(i) of the independent and dependent variables. */
  /* It finds only those roots for which some g(i), as a function */
  /* of t, changes sign in the interval of integration. */
  /* It then returns the solution at the root, if that occurs */
  /* sooner than the specified stop condition, and otherwise returns */
  /* the solution according the specified stop condition. */

  /* Summary of Usage. */

  /* Communication between the user and the DLSODAR package, for normal */
  /* situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset */
  /* of the full set of options available.  See the full description for */
  /* details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix, */
  /* optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and */
  /* instructions for special situations.  See also the example */
  /* problem (with program and output) following this summary. */

  /* A. First provide a subroutine of the form: */
  /*               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT) */
  /*               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*) */
  /* which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i). */

  /* B. Provide a subroutine of the form: */
  /*               SUBROUTINE G (NEQ, T, Y, NG, GOUT) */
  /*               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), GOUT(NG) */
  /* which supplies the vector function g by loading GOUT(i) with */
  /* g(i), the i-th constraint function whose root is sought. */

  /* C. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODAR once for */
  /* each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide */
  /* for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages by */
  /* DLSODAR.  On the first call to DLSODAR, supply arguments as follows: */
  /* F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f. */
  /*          This name must be declared External in calling program. */
  /* NEQ    = number of first order ODEs. */
  /* Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ. */
  /* T      = the initial value of the independent variable. */
  /* TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T). */
  /* ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array. */
  /* RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar). */
  /* ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array). */
  /*          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as */
  /*          to be less than */
  /*             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or */
  /*             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2. */
  /*          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component, */
  /*          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)), */
  /*          or the relative error is less than RTOL. */
  /*          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and */
  /*          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error */
  /*          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these */
  /*          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively. */
  /* ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT. */
  /* ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1. */
  /* IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used. */
  /* RWORK  = real work array of length at least: */
  /*             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9) + 3*NG. */
  /*          See also Paragraph F below. */
  /* LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension). */
  /* IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ. */
  /* LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension). */
  /* JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix. */
  /*          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph F below. */
  /* JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2. */
  /*          See also Paragraph F below. */
  /* G      = name of subroutine for constraint functions, whose */
  /*          roots are desired during the integration. */
  /*          This name must be declared External in calling program. */
  /* NG     = number of constraint functions g(i).  If there are none, */
  /*          set NG = 0, and pass a dummy name for G. */
  /* JROOT  = integer array of length NG for output of root information. */
  /*          See next paragraph. */
  /* Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK, */
  /* JROOT, and possibly ATOL. */

  /* D. The output from the first call (or any call) is: */
  /*      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector. */
  /*      T = corresponding value of independent variable.  This is */
  /*          TOUT if ISTATE = 2, or the root location if ISTATE = 3, */
  /*          or the farthest point reached if DLSODAR was unsuccessful. */
  /* ISTATE = 2 or 3  if DLSODAR was successful, negative otherwise. */
  /*           2 means no root was found, and TOUT was reached as desired. */
  /*           3 means a root was found prior to reaching TOUT. */
  /*          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT). */
  /*          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small). */
  /*          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message). */
  /*          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs). */
  /*          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian */
  /*                   supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances). */
  /*          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution */
  /*             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.) */
  /*          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages). */
  /*         -33 means One or more components of g have a root too near */
  /*                   to the initial point. */
  /* JROOT  = array showing roots found if ISTATE = 3 on return. */
  /*          JROOT(i) = 1 if g(i) has a root at t, or 0 otherwise. */

  /* E. To continue the integration after a successful return, proceed */
  /* as follows: */
  /*  (a) If ISTATE = 2 on return, reset TOUT and call DLSODAR again. */
  /*  (b) If ISTATE = 3 on return, reset ISTATE to 2, call DLSODAR again. */
  /* In either case, no other parameters need be reset. */

  /* F. Note: If and when DLSODAR regards the problem as stiff, and */
  /* switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ */
  /* Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the */
  /* inputs to DLSODAR recommended in Paragraph C above cause DLSODAR to */
  /* treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by */
  /* difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band */
  /* matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK */
  /* array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply */
  /* J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC */
  /* argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on */
  /* RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below. */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Example Problem. */

  /* The following is a simple example problem, with the coding */
  /* needed for its solution by DLSODAR.  The problem is from chemical */
  /* kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations: */
  /*     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3 */
  /*     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2 */
  /*     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2 */
  /* on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions */
  /* y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff. */
  /* In addition, we want to find the values of t, y1, y2, and y3 at which */
  /*   (1) y1 reaches the value 1.e-4, and */
  /*   (2) y3 reaches the value 1.e-2. */

  /* The following coding solves this problem with DLSODAR, */
  /* printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10, and at the computed */
  /* roots.  It uses ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 */
  /* because y2 has much smaller values. */
  /* At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are */
  /* printed (see optional outputs in the full description below). */

  /* Full Description of User Interface to DLSODAR. */

  /* The user interface to DLSODAR consists of the following parts. */

  /* 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODAR, which is a driver */
  /*      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both */
  /*      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines. */
  /*      Following these descriptions is a description of */
  /*      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then */
  /*      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays). */

  /* 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODAR package that may be */
  /*      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to */
  /*      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal */
  /*      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t). */

  /* 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay */
  /*      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt */
  /*      of the problem and continued solution later. */

  /* 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODAR package, */
  /*      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired. */
  /*      this relates to the measurement of errors. */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 1.  Call Sequence. */

  /* The call sequence parameters used for input only are */
  /*     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, */
  /*     JT, G, and NG, */
  /* that used only for output is  JROOT, */
  /* and those used for both input and output are */
  /*     Y, T, ISTATE. */
  /* The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and */
  /* optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers */
  /* to the return from Subroutine DLSODAR to the user's calling program.) */

  /* The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the */
  /* initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a */
  /* change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input. */

  /* The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows. */

  /* F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the */
  /*          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order */
  /*          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function */
  /*          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to */
  /*          compute the function f.  It is to have the form */
  /*               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT) */
  /*               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*) */
  /*          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y) */
  /*          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ. */
  /*          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ). */
  /*          F must be declared External in the calling program. */

  /*          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in */
  /*          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array */
  /*          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1). */
  /*          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below. */

  /*          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed */
  /*          externally to DLSODAR, an extra call to F should be made */
  /*          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results. */
  /*          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead. */

  /* NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order */
  /*          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input. */
  /*          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem. */
  /*          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the */
  /*          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if */
  /*          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC. */

  /*          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to */
  /*          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However, */
  /*          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size. */
  /*          (The DLSODAR package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case, */
  /*          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls */
  /*          to F, JAC, and G.  Hence, if it is an array, locations */
  /*          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass */
  /*          it to F, JAC, and G.  Each such subroutine must include */
  /*          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case. */

  /* Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of */
  /*          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the */
  /*          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls. */
  /*          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial */
  /*          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector, */
  /*          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used */
  /*          for other purposes between calls to the solver. */

  /*          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to F, */
  /*          JAC, and G.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations */
  /*          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and */
  /*          pass it to F, JAC, and G.  (The DLSODAR package accesses only */
  /*          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).) */

  /* T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the */
  /*          first call, as the initial point of the integration. */
  /*          On output, after each call, T is the value at which a */
  /*          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT). */
  /*          If a root was found, T is the computed location of the */
  /*          root reached first, on output. */
  /*          On an error return, T is the farthest point reached. */

  /* TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired. */
  /*          Used only for input. */

  /*          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal */
  /*          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call. */
  /*          For the initial T, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used */
  /*          in order to determine the direction of the integration */
  /*          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough */
  /*          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction */
  /*          (forward or backward in t) is permitted. */

  /*          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after */
  /*          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T). */
  /*          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call. */

  /*          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be */
  /*          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited */
  /*          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are */
  /*          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for */
  /*          TCUR and HU). */

  /* ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See */
  /*          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input. */

  /* RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or */
  /*          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL. */
  /*          Input only. */

  /* ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or */
  /*          an array of length NEQ.  Input only. */

  /*             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine */
  /*          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will */
  /*          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors */
  /*          in y, according to an inequality of the form */
  /*                      max-norm of (E(i)/EWT(i))   .le.   1, */
  /*          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights. */
  /*          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative. */
  /*          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of */
  /*          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i). */

  /*             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i) */
  /*              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL */
  /*              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i) */
  /*              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL */
  /*              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i) */

  /*          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not */
  /*          be dimensioned in the user's calling program. */

  /*          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL */
  /*          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general */
  /*          error controls can be obtained by substituting a */
  /*          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT. */
  /*          See Part 4 below. */

  /*          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated */
  /*          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all */
  /*          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled */
  /*          down uniformly. */

  /* ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed. */
  /*          input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings. */
  /*          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at */
  /*             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating). */
  /*          2  means take one step only and return. */
  /*          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or */
  /*             beyond t = TOUT and return. */
  /*          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at */
  /*             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT. */
  /*             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to */
  /*             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of */
  /*             integration.  This option is useful if the problem */
  /*             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT. */
  /*          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return. */
  /*             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1). */

  /*          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT */
  /*          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to */
  /*          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT, */
  /*          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first). */

  /* ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the */
  /*          the state of the calculation. */

  /*          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows. */
  /*          1  means this is the first call for the problem */
  /*             (initializations will be done).  See note below. */
  /*          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation */
  /*             is to continue normally, with no change in any input */
  /*             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK. */
  /*             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls */
  /*             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not */
  /*             tested for legality.) */
  /*          3  means this is not the first call, and the */
  /*             calculation is to continue normally, but with */
  /*             a change in input parameters other than */
  /*             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in */
  /*             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU, */
  /*             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS. */
  /*             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.) */
  /*             In addition, immediately following a return with */
  /*             ISTATE = 3 (root found), NG and G may be changed. */
  /*             (But changing NG from 0 to .gt. 0 is not allowed.) */
  /*          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted */
  /*          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of */
  /*          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the */
  /*          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.) */
  /*          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires */
  /*          ISTATE = 1 on input. */

  /*          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings. */
  /*           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = t and ISTATE = 1 on input. */
  /*           2  means the integration was performed successfully, and */
  /*              no roots were found. */
  /*           3  means the integration was successful, and one or more */
  /*              roots were found before satisfying the stop condition */
  /*              specified by ITASK.  See JROOT. */
  /*          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP */
  /*              steps) was done on this call, before completing the */
  /*              requested task, but the integration was otherwise */
  /*              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input */
  /*              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may */
  /*              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again */
  /*              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0). */
  /*              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid */
  /*              this error return (see below on optional inputs). */
  /*          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision */
  /*              of the machine being used.  This was detected before */
  /*              completing the requested task, but the integration */
  /*              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance */
  /*              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set */
  /*              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this */
  /*              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before */
  /*              taking any steps, then an illegal input return */
  /*              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.) */
  /*          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any */
  /*              integration steps.  See written message for details. */
  /*              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls */
  /*              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause */
  /*              the run to stop. */
  /*          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on */
  /*              one attempted step, before completing the requested */
  /*              task, but the integration was successful as far as T. */
  /*              The problem may have a singularity, or the input */
  /*              may be inappropriate. */
  /*          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on */
  /*              one attempted step, before completing the requested */
  /*              task, but the integration was successful as far as T. */
  /*              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix, */
  /*              if one is being used. */
  /*          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the */
  /*              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0) */
  /*              was requested on a variable which has now vanished. */
  /*              The integration was successful as far as T. */
  /*          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to */
  /*              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T. */
  /*              This happens when DLSODAR chooses to switch methods */
  /*              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method. */
  /*         -33  means One or more components of g have a root too near */
  /*              to the initial point. This happens when a root is constant */
  /*              and zero. */

  /*          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2, */
  /*          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation. */
  /*          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be */
  /*          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the */
  /*          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before */
  /*          calling the solver again. */

  /* IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional */
  /*          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only. */
  /*          The optional inputs are listed separately below. */
  /*          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used. */
  /*                   Default values will be used in all cases. */
  /*          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used. */

  /* RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the */
  /*          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and */
  /*          optional outputs. */
  /*          As DLSODAR switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff */
  /*          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the */
  /*          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODAR can either */
  /*          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods, */
  /*          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling */
  /*          program in response to output from DLSODAR. */

  /*                       --- Fixed Length Case --- */
  /*          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least */
  /*               max (LRN, LRS), */
  /*          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the */
  /*          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively. */

  /*          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are */
  /*          as follows: */
  /*          If NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have */
  /*          their default values, then */
  /*             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ + 3*NG, */
  /*             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2 + 3*NG           (JT = 1 or 2), */
  /*             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ + 3*NG   (JT = 4 or 5). */
  /*          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by: */
  /*             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ + 3*NG, */
  /*             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT + 3*NG, */
  /*          where */

  /*             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5. */

  /*                       --- Dynamic Length Case --- */
  /*          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should */
  /*          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the */
  /*          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since */
  /*          DLSODAR starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return */
  /*          from DLSODAR, the optional output MCUR indicates the current */
  /*          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the */
  /*          previous return, or if there has only been one call to */
  /*          DLSODAR and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODAR has switched */

  /*                             a successful return from DLSODAR. */

  /* The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows. */
  /* The form of the call is: */

  /*   LYH = 21 + 3*NG */
  /*   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(LYH), NYH, DKY, IFLAG) */

  /* The input parameters are: */

  /* T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired */
  /*             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODAR). */
  /*             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR. */
  /*             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.) */
  /* K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy */
  /*             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order */
  /*             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding */
  /*             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided */
  /*             by DLSODAR directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first */

  /* IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal, */

  /*             On an error return, a message is also written. */
  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 3.  Common Blocks. */

  /* If DLSODAR is to be used in an overlay situation, the user */
  /* must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in: */
  /*   (1) the call sequence to DLSODAR, and */
  /*   (2) the three internal Common blocks */
  /*         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words */
  /*                      followed by 37 integer words), */
  /*         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words */
  /*                      followed by  9 integer words). */
  /*         /DLSR01/  of length   7  (3 double precision words */
  /*                      followed by  4 integer words). */

  /* If DLSODAR is used on a system in which the contents of internal */
  /* Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should */
  /* declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure */
  /* that their contents are preserved. */

  /* If the solution of a given problem by DLSODAR is to be interrupted */
  /* and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run */
  /* or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save, */
  /* following the return from the last DLSODAR call prior to the */
  /* interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the */
  /* internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the */
  /* next DLSODAR call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common */
  /* blocks, use Subroutine DSRCAR (see Part 2 above). */

  /* ----------------------------------------------------------------------- */
  /* Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines. */

  /* Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODAR package which */
  /* relates to the measurement of errors, and can be */
  /* replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such */
  /* a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be */
  /* done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution. */
  /* (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is */
  /* superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.) */

  /* (a) DEWSET. */
  /* The following subroutine is called just before each internal */
  /* integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as */
  /* described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above: */
  /*     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT) */
  /* where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODAR call sequence, */
  /* YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and */
  /* EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET. */

  /* If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i) */
  /* (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors */
  /* in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the */
  /* DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODAR in the computation */
  /* of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference */
  /* quotient Jacobians. */

  /* In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use */
  /* the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ */
  /* are available from the history array YH, described above under */
  /* optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array, */
  /* extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale */
  /* factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem, */
  /* given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0. */
  /* NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST */
  /* can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements: */
  /*     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS */
  /*     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37) */
  /*     NQ = ILS(33) */
  /*     NST = ILS(34) */
  /*     H = RLS(212) */
  /* Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as */
  /* YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is */
  /* unnecessary when NST = 0). */
